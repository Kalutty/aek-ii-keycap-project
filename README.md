# Keycaps Inspired by Apple Extended Keyboard II

## Description
After buying an old Apple Extended Keyboard II on ebay,

I decided to make myself a copy of the keycaps as a layout for a Cherry MX based mechanical keyboard.  WASD offer a service to make custom key caps for $50 a set (104/5 key set.)

After a little research I found out that the older Apple Keyboards use the Universe 57 Oblique font (although it's a slightly modified version than the one which can be purchased from Linotype.) The @, $ and & are fairly different, and the _ - = + / | are custom drawn for the keyboard, as they are oversized and significantly different from the font glyphs.  

There is (what appears to be) rounding of some sort on almost all of the glyphs, although this may be due to laser etching techniques in the early 90s, I haven't been able to find any concrete info about it.

Anyway, the results of my work are what you see here, the [svg](svg/apple-wasd-layout.svg) reproduction took a little over 4 hours to put together. WASD turned it around and shipped it to Singapore in about a week.  Please feel free to grab the svg and use it yourself, or modify it.  I expect this could be seen as copyright infringement by Apple, but I hope it's just regarded as an homage.
